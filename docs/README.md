## 📝 Project Management Processes — Overview

OctoAcme’s approach to project management is guided by a set of principles that emphasize customer value, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and transparent communication. The process is structured around a defined lifecycle that includes initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement.

- **Key roles** such as Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, and QA are clearly defined, with responsibilities for each phase. Collaboration and feedback are central, supported by regular ceremonies (standups, weekly syncs, demos, and retrospectives).
- **Workflows** leverage project boards, small PRs with automated checks, thorough planning, and comprehensive checklists to ensure high quality, timely delivery, and risk mitigation.
- **Communication** is scheduled and purposeful, using standardized status updates, risk registers, and escalation paths to keep all stakeholders informed and aligned.
- **Quality assurance** is woven throughout the process via unit/integration/E2E testing, CI pipelines, security scans, and rigorous manual QA, all supported by detailed documentation and templates.
